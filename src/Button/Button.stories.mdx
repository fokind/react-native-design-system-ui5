# Button

```js
import { Button } from 'react-native-fundmental';
```

A **Button** allows users to perform an action. The priority of buttons within a page should be considered. For instance, only use the main button once within a page or dialog. Color is also important. For instance, the most important button has a blue background where as a red button should only be used if the action it performs is potentially destructive.

# Examples

## Primary

<Preview>
  <Story name="primary">
    <Button onPress={() => {}}>Press me</Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

# Properties

<Props of={Button} />
